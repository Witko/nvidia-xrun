# When enabled, nvidia-xrun will turn the card on before attempting to load the
# modules and running the command, and turn it off after the commands exits and
# the modules gets unloaded. If order for this to work, CONTROLLER_BUS_ID and
# DEVICE_BUS_ID must be set correctly. IDs can be found by by inspecting the
# output of lshw.
ENABLE_PM=1

# When PM is enabled, remove the card from the system after the command exists
# and modules unload: the card will be readded in the next nvidia-xrun
# execution before loading the nvidia module again. This is recommended as Xorg
# and some other programs tend to load the nvidia module if they detect a
# nvidia card in the system, and when the module is loaded the card can't save
# power.
#
# USE_BBSWITCH option below can override the behavior of this option.
REMOVE_DEVICE=1

# When enabled, nvidia-xrun will toggle power for the card using bbswitch.
# This *requires* bbswitch to be installed.
#
# Note that this option overrides REMOVE_DEVICE paramter above when enabled.
